                Ever since I was a kid I was never invested in my Arabic Language, that is when it came to my free time of course. I used to watch Disney channel, listen to only strictly English music and just speak in English most of the time. And really who could blame me? I thought it was "cool".
            </h3>
            <h3>
                What I did not know that I was slowly building up this very awful misconception or stigma if you will. "Oh she’s American now", "She does not like to speak Arabic Owh May Gawd". Maybe that was bullying, but that stuck with me… Well obviously, with the latter choices made in my life. And yes for some time I did have a dream, to be American to live in the United States and of course to meet my beloved band (which broke up now). 
            </h3>
            <h3>
                I had grown out of all this fangirling and have a more reflecting opinion on the now nourished and flourished, but by no means ideal or perfected or even wise, ideology of mine.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                In my third fall semester and in my introduction to theater class in specific, we had trailed off to discuss a topic that was in a video. The topic was of course about Lebanon and Generation Z. How the millennials had messed up and it was only up to generation Z to fix it. Us. 
                Well my impulsive thinking had other plans and I said what’s on my mind. I huffed and I said: "We get it, instead of them nagging us how about the provide us with solutions or precautions so we don't fall into their footsteps?" 
                My instructor was somewhat interested and flustered. She said: "But why this frustration? Are you giving up on your country? This is a very unhealthy sort of ideology”. Like many other discussions in my class, I was able to express my freedom of speech, in the means of the ability to say whatever is on my mind without censorship, with the risk of offending people. That then gave me the chance to reflect, research, and build a stronger foundation and information. 
                Earlier in the same class, we were discussing how Generation Z is compared to zombies. Contagious and slowly heading to infinite destruction. We must be careful not to get infected, at the same time being able to expand our bubble. And by asking these questions in the previous paragraph, my instructor was warning me to not get sucked in the "Lebanon sucks I want to graduate and leave" tornado. 
                Here is the thing. I don't and I never wanted to.
            </h3>
            <h3> 
                It is very prominent that my thought process is not always very clear and thus this piece to explain my current position. Here goes the truth.
                I value the Arabic Language, so much. The language of the Qur'an is such a blessing. It's very shameful that I am not fluent in it. I consider English my mother tongue. That does not mean that I hate being an Arab. It merely means that it has always been easier for me to express myself in English. I listen to a total of 5 Arabic songs (ever) and that's my limit, I tried to love Arabic music, that just is not going to work. I tried to read novels in Arabic, I tried writing in Arabic (which I do love), unfortunately it is a skill that is still underdeveloped, very high maintenance and not being worked on as supposed to.
                Again, it does not mean that I give up on my country or that I hate being an Arab. 
                So it did occur to me how much I must have given the image of wanting to e westerner. 
                I am not a pessimist about this. Neither am I infected by zombies that think that our end is horrendous. I want to stay in Lebanon and be productive. I want to serve my country! I am just a realist and being practical about it. Meaning that I will do the previously mentioned things, however I will not expect a significant change. Change is slow and small, and it takes time. I am not giving up on my country, but I would not be disappointed if it doesn't directly work out. 
            </h3>
            <h2 class="hana1">
                So Dear self-hating Arabs, it is somewhat pitful to hate a core part of you that you cannot change, I encourage you to try and be in peace with yourself. 
                Yours Truly,
                Hannah
